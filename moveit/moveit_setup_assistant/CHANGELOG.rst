0.7.0 (2016-01-30)
------------------
* Merge pull request from ipa-mdl/indigo-devel
  Added command-line SRDF updater
* renamed target output to collisions_updater
* formatted code to roscpp style
* More verbose error descriptions, use ROS_ERROR_STREAM
* moved file loader helpers into tools
* added licence header
* Missed a negation sign
* CollisionUpdater class was not really needed
* factored out createFullURDFPath and createFullSRDFPath
* factored out MoveItConfigData::getSetupAssistantYAMLPath
* factored out MoveItConfigData::setPackagePath
* factored out setCollisionLinkPairs into MoveItConfigData
* require output path to be set if SRDF path is overwritten by a xacro file path
* separated xacro parsing from loadFileToString
* make disabled_collisions entries unique
* Added command-line SRDF updater
* Merge pull request from 130s/fix/windowsize
  Shrink window height
* Add scrollbar to the text area that could be squashed.
* Better minimum window size.
* Merge pull request #103  from gavanderhoorn/issue102_cfgrble_db_path
  Fix for issue #102 : allow user to set mongodb db location
* Update warehouse launch file to accept non-standard db location. Fix #102.
  Also update generated demo.launch accordingly.
  The default directory could be located on a non-writable file system, leading
  to crashes of the mongodb wrapper script. This change allows the user to specify
  an alternative location using the 'db_path' argument.
* Update configuration_files_widget.cpp
  Fix link

0.6.0 (2014-12-01)
------------------
* Values are now read from kinematics.yaml correctly.
* Simplified the inputKinematicsYAML() code.
* Debug and octomap improvements in launch file templates
* Values are now read from kinematics.yaml correctly. Previously, keys such
  as "kinematics_solver" were not found.
* Added clear octomap service to move_group launch file template
* Added gdb debug helper that allows easier break point addition
* Add launch file for joystick control of MotionPlanningPlugin
* Joint limits comments
* Removed velocity scaling factor
* Added a new 'velocity_scaling_factor' parameter to evenly reduce max joint velocity for all joints. Added documentation.
* Simply renamed kin_model to robot_model for more proper naming convension
* Added new launch file for controll Rviz with joystick
* use relative instead of absolute names for topics (to allow for namespaces)
* Added planner specific parameters to ompl_planning.yaml emitter.
* Added space after every , in function calls
  Added either a space or a c-return before opening {
  Moved & next to the variable in the member function declarations
* Added planner specific parameters to ompl_planning.yaml emitter.
  Each parameter is set to current defaults. This is fragile, as defaults may change.
